<h1>mean-angularjs</h1>
<h2>Single Page Application</h2>

<p>This is my first SPA test-project using MEAN-STACK (angularjs-1.6.6 precisely). With lots of work on both the backend and frontend view, I will call it a shot here to move on with latest <a href=http://angular.io> <b>angular</b></a> (v5.x as of the time this was written).</p> 
<p><b>Note: </b>The frontend design view was not awesomely designed as it was not the focus of this project, however I used some bootstrap and fontawesome to tweaks some views.</p>
<p>Known issues include,
  <ul>
  <li>Unable to delete user(staff) profile from the frontend though it works perfectly from the backend</li>
  <li>You may experience browser freezing while trying to get a user profile details when logged-in</li>
  </ul>
  <i>Reveiw and corrections are welcome</i>
